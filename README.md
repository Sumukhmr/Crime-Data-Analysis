# Crime-Data-Analytics
Using the datasets provided by NCRB, We were able to build a predictive ML model using Python Language and one of the popular ML algorithm, Gradient Boost Regressor which could predict the future crime rates. We were able to achieve 98.92% accuracy.My role in this project was Team lead and I built the predictive model.
